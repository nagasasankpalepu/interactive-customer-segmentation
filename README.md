# Interactive Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer segmentation solution using
Python for data analysis and machine learning, and Tableau for interactive
visualization.

The goal of the project is to understand different types of customers by
grouping them into meaningful segments using K-Means clustering and presenting
the insights in an interactive dashboard.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tableau Desktop

---

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
4. Assigning segment labels to customers
5. Exporting processed data for visualization
6. Building an interactive dashboard in Tableau

---

## Customer Segmentation Approach
- K-Means clustering algorithm is used
- Customers are grouped based on behavioral and tenure-related features
- Each cluster represents a distinct customer segment
- Segments help in understanding customer patterns and behavior

---

## Deliverables
- Python notebook containing clustering code and analysis
- Processed dataset with customer segments
- Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx)
- One-page project description

---

## Use Cases
- Customer behavior analysis
- Marketing strategy planning
- Business decision support
- Customer retention analysis

---

## How to Use
1. Open the Python notebook to view clustering logic
2. Open the Tableau `.twbx` file in Tableau Desktop
3. Interact with the dashboard using filters and charts
4. Explore customer segments and insights
